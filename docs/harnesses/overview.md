# Harnesses Overview

AGRO installs no agent CLI at boot. A harness enters the sandbox only when you run `agro harness install <id>`. **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Pi**, **OpenCode**, **Hermes**, and **Grok Build** install this way. The install lands in `~/.local` inside the persistent home volume, so it survives a container recreate. No harness is baked into the image. **T3 Code** is on demand: the `/t3` skill (or `npx t3`) fetches it and serves a browser UI on port 3773. Inside the sandbox, run `agro tool install herdr`, then run `herdr`, then launch whichever agent you prefer from its panes and switch between them at any time. Reserve tmux for AGRO's managed/headless gateway, tunnel, and detached cron-fire infrastructure; systemd supervises the cron runtime itself.

AGRO is the harness; the **agent** is your call. To go beyond the catalog, install via `npm` / `pip` / `cargo` inside the sandbox or edit the Dockerfile. For Pi+Slack specifically, the recommended path is the `pi-messenger-bridge` npm package — see [Slack integration](../integrations/slack.md). The product surface is one developer, one project, one agent — not racing or stacking multiple CLIs against each other.

## Installing a harness

`agro harness install <id>` is the only door. It probes the running sandbox,
installs the CLI into `~/.local` in the persistent home volume, and reports. It
writes no project `agro.json` field. It never rebuilds or restarts the sandbox.

```bash
agro harness list                 # what exists, and what is installed
agro harness install opencode     # install into the running sandbox
agro harness uninstall opencode   # remove it again
agro harness status hermes        # one harness
```

### Installing on the host

When the sandbox is not running, `install` offers a host installation. A host
with no container runtime takes the same path: `agro` treats an unspawnable
runtime as an unreachable sandbox and installs on the host. The host path needs
no Docker.

An interactive run asks for confirmation. Answer `n` to install nothing; the
command then exits non-zero and points at `agro sandbox`. A non-interactive run
needs `--host` or `--path`. Without either flag it keeps the refusal, so scripts
see the same exit code as before.

The host path uses two distinct locations.

| Location | What it holds | How you choose it |
|---|---|---|
| Harness root | An existing AGRO workspace, which carries the control plane | `--workspace <name>` or `--path <dir>`, else the recorded `harnessRoot`, else `~/.agro/workspaces/harness` |
| Install prefix | The harness binaries, at `<prefix>/bin` | Always `~/.local` for the invoking user |

The command creates no workspace. Create the implicit workspace first with
`agro workspace create`, or create a named workspace with `agro workspace create <name>` — see
[Lifecycle commands → Host workspaces](../lifecycle-commands.md#host-workspaces-agro-workspace).
When the resolved harness root holds no git checkout, the command exits 1. The
refusal lists every workspace that exists and names `agro workspace create`.

The command installs the harness into `~/.local`. It writes nothing into the
workspace, so the checkout stays clean. Every harness lands in the same normal
per-user prefix. If `~/.local/bin` is not on your `PATH`, the command prints the
`export PATH` line to add.

```bash
agro workspace create                               # create the implicit harness workspace
agro workspace create acme                          # create a named workspace first
agro harness install claude-code --workspace acme   # install from ~/.agro/workspaces/acme
agro harness install claude-code --host             # install from the resolved default root
agro harness install claude-code --path /srv/agro   # install from /srv/agro, outside the registry
```

Work from the harness root. A harness started outside an AGRO checkout finds no
`AGENTS.md`, no `.agro/skills/`, no hooks and no task state, so `cd` into the
harness root before you start the harness. The command prints the launch line as
its last line, in the form `cd <root> && <binary>`. For a harness that declares a
bypass-permissions flag, the line carries that flag, because a first-run
folder-trust prompt can ignore the project `defaultMode`.

A successful install records two things in `~/.agro/config.json`: `harnessRoot`,
the selected workspace root, and a `hostHarnesses` entry for the harness carrying the
prefix and the binary it created. Neither is recorded when the install fails.

A host install selects a workspace with `--workspace <name>` or `--path <dir>`.
A successful install records that root as `harnessRoot`. The recorded root is
sticky: every later host install reports the recorded root and selects it again,
without asking for a name. Pass `--workspace <name>` or `--path <dir>` to select
another workspace; a successful install records the new value.

Harness root precedence:

1. `--workspace <name>` or `--path <dir>` — pass one, not both
2. `harnessRoot` in `~/.agro/config.json`
3. `~/.agro/workspaces/harness`

Each candidate must already hold a git checkout. The command clones nothing.

A host workspace is a named registry entry, exactly like a sandbox:

```
~/.agro/
├── config.json           host config
├── sandboxes/  <name>/   sandbox registry
└── workspaces/ <name>/   host workspace registry
```

`agro workspace create <name>` writes that entry, and no other command writes
one. The name becomes a path segment, so it obeys the sandbox name rule:
lowercase letters, digits and dashes, starting with a letter or a digit.
`agro workspace create` refuses any other name and creates nothing.
`agro workspace list` prints every entry and marks the recorded `harnessRoot`.

The state home itself is never the harness root. A checkout at `~/.agro` or
`~/.oh` makes `~` resolve as a project root with two generations, which blocks
every `agro` command run from `~`.

The host path refuses in three cases, and it moves nothing by itself.

| Case | What it says |
|---|---|
| `~/.oh` exists and `~/.agro` does not | host state now lives in `~/.agro`; migrate first with `agro migrate --home` |
| `~/.oh` and `~/.agro` both exist | the state home is split; merge it with `agro migrate --home` |
| The resolved harness root is `~/.oh` or `~/.agro` itself | move that directory out, for example `mv ~/.agro ~/agro` |

Before it installs, the command runs `link-providers.sh --init` in the harness
root, exactly as the sandbox entrypoint does on every boot. A failure fails the
install and names the command to run.

An `on-demand` harness installs nothing on the host. The command says so and
exits 0.

`agro harness` works from inside the sandbox too. There it installs into the
environment you are already in, and `list`/`status` report the CLIs actually
present rather than `?`. See
[Lifecycle commands → Where you are standing when you type `agro`](../lifecycle-commands.md#where-you-are-standing-when-you-type-agro).

Flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json` | `list` and `status` only: machine-readable output |
| `--host` | `install` only: install on the host when the sandbox is not running |
| `--workspace <name>` | `install` only: select the existing host workspace `~/.agro/workspaces/<name>`; implies `--host` |
| `--path <dir>` | `install` only: select an existing harness root outside the registry; implies `--host` |
| `--force` | `uninstall` only: remove on the host with no recorded install |

`list` and `status` reject `--host` and `--path`. When the sandbox is not
running they probe the host install prefix `~/.local`, but only once a harness
root holds a workspace or that prefix exists. They never clone. Each row carries
a `location` of `sandbox`, `host`, or `unknown`, and the table names the probed
prefix.

## Updating a harness

Two paths update a harness in the sandbox. Both land in `/home/sandbox/.local`
in the persistent home volume.

```bash
agro harness install claude-code   # re-run the door; installs the latest version
claude update                      # the harness updates itself
```

The harness self-update path works because npm's global prefix in the sandbox is
`/home/sandbox/.local`, not `/usr/local`. The sandbox image exports
`NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX="$NPM_USER_PREFIX"`, so a bare `npm install -g` from a
harness updater writes to the home volume and the update survives a container
recreate.

Never run a harness update through `sudo`. The harness binaries are not on
sudo's `secure_path`, so `sudo claude update` reports `command not found`. A
root-owned global install would also land outside the home volume and disappear
on the next recreate.

A container created before this prefix existed picks it up at the next boot: the
entrypoint adds the export to the home mount's shell profile.

## Removing a harness

`agro harness uninstall <id>` undoes an install. It resolves its target exactly
as `install` does: the running sandbox when one is reachable, the host when none
is.

In the sandbox it removes from `/home/sandbox/.local` with no further checks,
because AGRO owns that prefix outright.

On the host it removes only what it recorded. The `hostHarnesses` entry written
by a successful host install names the prefix, and `uninstall` removes from that
prefix — never from a freshly computed one, so moving your home directory cannot
make it miss or hit the wrong path. With no record it refuses and exits non-zero,
because the binary may be one you installed yourself. `--force` removes from
`~/.local` anyway. A successful removal deletes the record; a failed one leaves
it in place.

An interactive run confirms the harness and the exact prefix before it removes
anything. A non-interactive run proceeds, so scripts keep working. A harness that
is not installed reports so and exits 0 without removing anything, and clears a
stale record if one exists. An `on-demand` harness reports that there is nothing
to remove and exits 0.

```bash
agro harness uninstall opencode           # sandbox if running, else the host record
agro harness uninstall opencode --force   # host removal with no record, from ~/.local
```

Each catalog entry has a `kind`. `installable` harnesses install through the
verb. `on-demand` harnesses (T3 Code) are fetched by `npx` at each run and are
never installed. There is no other install path, and no configuration key
selects one.

An install persists because the home volume persists. `agro destroy` removes that
volume, and the install with it.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Role | Start command | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](./claude-code.md) | Anthropic's terminal coding agent | `claude` | `agro harness install claude-code` |
| [Codex](./codex.md) | OpenAI's CLI coding agent | `codex` | `agro harness install codex` |
| [OpenCode](./opencode.md) | Terminal coding agent with OpenAI OAuth support | `opencode` | `agro harness install opencode` |
| [Pi](./pi.md) | Lightweight, customizable agent | `pi` | `agro harness install pi` |
| [Hermes](./hermes.md) | Nous Research's self-improving terminal agent | `hermes` | `agro harness install hermes` |
| [Grok Build](./grok-build.md) | xAI's proprietary Grok Build terminal agent | `grok` | `agro harness install grok-build` |

## Verifying installation

```bash
# Each CLI is present only after `agro harness install <id>`:
claude --version
codex --version
pi --version
opencode --version
hermes --version
grok --version
muse --version
agy --version

npx t3 --version        # T3 Code — on demand, fetched by npx
```

## Authentication

Install a harness with `agro harness install <id>`, then authenticate it. Authenticate at least one harness before use:

- **Claude Code**: run `claude` and follow the OAuth prompt (see [Claude Code](./claude-code.md)).
- **Codex**: run `codex login` (see [Codex](./codex.md)).
- **OpenCode**: run `opencode auth login` (see [OpenCode](./opencode.md)).
- **Pi**: configure provider keys via environment variables (see [Pi](./pi.md)).
- **Hermes**: run `hermes setup` (see [Hermes](./hermes.md)).
- **Muse Code**: run `muse login` inside the sandbox, or provide `META_API_KEY` to the launching process (see [Muse Code](./muse-code.md)).
- **Grok Build**: run `grok login --device-auth` for headless/remote auth, `grok login` for interactive OAuth, or set `XAI_API_KEY` as a fallback (see [Grok Build](./grok-build.md)). Cached `~/.grok/auth.json` takes precedence over `XAI_API_KEY`.
- **Antigravity CLI**: run `agy` and complete Google Sign-In; a remote sandbox prints an authorization URL and accepts a pasted code (see [Antigravity CLI](./antigravity-cli.md)). AGRO has not yet validated login inside the sandbox.
- **T3 Code**: authenticate one of Claude / Codex / OpenCode first, then run `/t3` (or `npx t3`) and open the printed pairing URL (see [T3 Code](./t3code.md)).

## Default surfaces

Two optional surfaces cover most day-to-day use:

- **Pi+Slack** — chat with the agent from Slack instead of the terminal.
- **T3 Code** — browser UI on port `3773` driving Claude / Codex / OpenCode.

Each runs in its own named tmux session per [`.agro/skills/t3/references/sandbox-processes.md`](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/blob/development/.agro/skills/t3/references/sandbox-processes.md). For the two browser surfaces, open them in **VS Code's Simple Browser** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Simple Browser: Show`; `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) so the live UI sits in a tab next to the code you're editing.

### Pi+Slack

The Pi agent with the Slack bridge loaded. Configuration is native — edit `.devcontainer/.env` + `.pi/msg-bridge.json` (see [Slack integration](../integrations/slack.md)). The `client-slack-pi` session is started automatically on container boot (or manually with `gateway pi`):

```bash
gateway status                   # show client-slack-pi + client-slack-hermes
tmux attach -t client-slack-pi   # watch the live log
```

Talk to the agent from Slack (DM or `@mention`). Full setup: [Slack integration](../integrations/slack.md).

### T3 Code

Web UI on `http://localhost:3773` over an already-authenticated provider. Prefer the agent skill:

```text
/t3 start
/t3 url
```

Manual terminal fallback:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s agent-t3code 'npx --yes t3 serve 2>&1 | tee /tmp/agent-t3code.log'
tmux capture-pane -t agent-t3code -p | grep -iE 'pair|token|url'
```

Open the printed pairing URL (`http://localhost:3773/pair#token=…`) in the Simple Browser tab. Full setup: [T3 Code](./t3code.md).

### Reattach to any session

```bash
tmux ls                          # list sessions
tmux attach -t <session-name>    # reattach (Ctrl-b d to detach)
```
