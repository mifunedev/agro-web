# Pi

Pi is a lightweight, customizable harness — a hackable agent framework you can shape to your project. Install it with `agro harness install pi`.

## Verify installation

```bash
pi --version
```

## Authentication

Pi's subscription login runs its own OAuth flow with a local callback server on `http://localhost:1455`. For the login to complete, the browser on your laptop has to reach port 1455 inside the container.

The base `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` publishes `127.0.0.1:1455:1455` so the callback port lands on the host loopback:

- **VS Code Remote SSH (works out of the box):** VS Code automatically forwards the loopback port to your laptop — just run the Pi login, the redirect completes with no extra step.
- **Direct terminal (plain `ssh`):** plain SSH does not auto-forward ports. Open the tunnel yourself before logging in:

  ```bash
  ssh -L 1455:localhost:1455 user@your-host
  ```

This is Pi-specific. The Codex CLI has its own headless path (`codex login --device-auth`) and does not need port 1455 — see [Codex § Authentication](./codex.md#authentication).

## Upstream

[`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) — see the upstream repository at [earendil-works/pi-mono](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono) for documentation, configuration, and roadmap. (The previous package, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, is deprecated — install the `@earendil-works/...` successor instead.)

## Default packages

AGRO loads these project-local Pi packages from `.pi/settings.json`:

- [`@tintinweb/pi-subagents`](https://pi.dev/packages/@tintinweb/pi-subagents) — Claude Code-style sub-agent commands for Pi, including FleetView (enabled by default). With an empty prompt, press `↓` (or `←`) to focus the agent list, then `↑`/`↓` to select and `Enter` to open an agent; toggle it via `/agents` → Settings → Fleet view.
- [`@tintinweb/pi-tasks`](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-tasks) — task tracking for Pi with `TaskCreate`, `TaskList`, `TaskGet`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskOutput`, `TaskStop`, and `TaskExecute` tools; a `/tasks` menu; and a persistent task widget. `TaskExecute` integrates with `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` so tracked tasks can run through configured subagents.
- [`@narumitw/pi-goal`](https://pi.dev/packages/@narumitw/pi-goal?name=goal) — `/goal <task>` mode that keeps Pi working until it verifies completion and calls the `goal_complete` tool. Use `/goal pause`, `/goal resume`, or `/goal clear` to manage the active goal.
- [`@narumitw/pi-codex-usage`](https://github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions/tree/main/extensions/pi-codex-usage) — `/codex-status` plus a compact `openai-codex` statusline for 5-hour session usage and weekly usage. AGRO pins `0.6.2`, which includes the upstream stale-`ExtensionContext` statusline timer fix that prevents crashes after Pi replaces an extension context.
- [`@trevonistrevon/pi-loop`](https://pi.dev/packages/@trevonistrevon/pi-loop?name=monitor) — Monitor and loop tools for background command monitoring and scheduled re-wakes. Use `MonitorCreate`, `MonitorList`, and `MonitorStop` for long-running commands; use `/loop` or `LoopCreate` for cron/event-triggered follow-up prompts.
- [`@guwidoe/pi-prompt-suggester`](https://github.com/guwidoe/pi-prompt-suggester) — intent-aware next-prompt suggestions after assistant completions. Suggestions can appear as ghost text in the editor, with `/suggesterSettings` for interactive configuration and `/suggester status` / `/suggester reseed` for inspection and manual reseeding.

Pi installs missing project packages automatically on startup after the project is trusted. AGRO also auto-loads project-local extensions from `.pi/extensions/`.

## Optional Langfuse observability

[Langfuse](../integrations/langfuse.md#2-pi) is an opt-in extension, not a default
`.pi/settings.json` package. The plugin captures prompts, outputs, tool calls,
and cost, and tags each trace `pi`.

Run `agro config langfuse` to configure the plugin. The wizard offers to install
`@langfuse/pi-observability-plugin` in user scope, writes `environment` and
`userId` to `~/.pi/agent/langfuse.json`, and renders the endpoint and both keys
into the credential fragment `~/.config/agro/langfuse.env`. The Pi config file
holds no `baseUrl` field, so Pi reads the endpoint from the environment.

### Codex stale-response recovery

The installed `@earendil-works/pi-ai` Codex Responses provider can reuse WebSocket cached continuation state by sending `previous_response_id`. If the upstream Codex backend forgets that response id, it returns `previous_response_not_found`; Pi clears the stale continuation but the failed user turn would otherwise be lost. AGRO keeps a small auto-loaded `.pi/extensions/codex-stale-response-retry.ts` extension that re-injects non-Slack failed turns once via `sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })`, causing the next request to start from fresh/full context. Slack-prefixed turns remain owned by the dedicated `.pi/bridge-recovery/` extension that is co-loaded with `pi-messenger-bridge`.

Outside this project, try the packages manually with `pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-goal`, `pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-codex-usage@0.6.2`, `pi -e npm:@trevonistrevon/pi-loop`, or `pi -e npm:@guwidoe/pi-prompt-suggester@0.3.10`.

## Prompt suggestions

AGRO enables `@guwidoe/pi-prompt-suggester` by default for interactive Pi sessions. The package watches completed turns, builds a lightweight project intent seed, and proposes the next likely user prompt.

```text
/suggesterSettings
/suggester status
/suggester reseed
/suggester config set suggestion.ghostAcceptKeys ["space","right"]
```

By default, compatible suggestions appear as ghost text when the editor is empty. Press `Space` to accept the full suggestion, or change the accept key and other behavior in `/suggesterSettings`. Suggester state, overrides, and logs live under Pi's agent data directory (`${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.pi/agent}/prompt-suggester/`), not in the workspace.

## Monitor and loops

Use Monitor for background commands that should keep running while the agent continues other work:

```text
MonitorCreate command="tail -n0 -f build.log" description="Watch build"
MonitorCreate command="python train.py" onDone="Analyze results and report best loss"
MonitorList
MonitorStop monitorId="1"
```

`onDone` creates a one-shot completion wake so the agent can inspect results without polling. Prefer Monitor over raw shell `while`/`sleep` loops for CI polling, experiments, long downloads, training jobs, log tails, and other parallel work.

Use loops for scheduled or event-triggered follow-up prompts:

```text
/loop 5m check the deploy
LoopCreate trigger="5m" prompt="Check if the build passed"
LoopCreate trigger="tool_execution_start" prompt="Log the tool being used" triggerType="event"
LoopList
LoopDelete id="1"
```

The package keeps a compact status line when loops, monitors, or native fallback tasks are active. AGRO leaves `PI_LOOP_SCOPE` unset, which means `session` scope: loop state is stored under `.pi/loops/loops-<sessionId>.json` and stays isolated across concurrent sessions and worktree agents. `.pi/loops/` is gitignored. Set `PI_LOOP_SCOPE=memory` for disposable no-disk state, `PI_LOOP_SCOPE=project` only when intentionally sharing loops across sessions, or `PI_LOOP=off` to disable the package store.

## Codex usage status

Use `/codex-status` to show ChatGPT Codex subscription usage without leaving Pi. AGRO enables `@narumitw/pi-codex-usage@0.6.2` by default; this fixed pin includes the upstream stale-`ExtensionContext` statusline timer cleanup, preventing timer callbacks from crashing after Pi replaces the extension context:

```text
/codex-status
/codex-status --refresh
/codex-status --no-statusline
/codex-status --clear-statusline
/codex-status --timeout 30
```

When the selected Pi model provider is `openai-codex`, the package refreshes a compact statusline item every five minutes, for example `📊 codex 59% 5h 61% wk`, so 5-hour session usage and weekly usage stay visible during the session. `/codex-status --refresh` bypasses the short in-memory cache.

Auth is layered: the extension uses Pi's own `openai-codex` provider auth first, then falls back to `codex app-server --listen stdio://` only when Pi auth cannot provide usable ChatGPT subscription auth. OpenAI API keys do not expose this quota.

## Task tracking

The default task runtime state lives under `.pi/tasks/`, which is gitignored. Leave the default for per-checkout task state; set `PI_TASKS=off` to disable task tracking; set `PI_TASKS=<named-list>` to select a named task list; or pass an explicit task-list path when you intentionally want a shared list outside the gitignored default.

`pi-loop` detects `@tintinweb/pi-tasks` over Pi's event bus. Because AGRO loads `pi-tasks` by default, `pi-loop` delegates task management to that package; its native fallback `TaskCreate`/`TaskList`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskDelete` tools and `/tasks` command only register in projects where `pi-tasks` is absent.

Removing the project recap package declaration does not delete existing runtime state or cached installations. A running Pi session retains `pi-recap` until you reload or restart the session. Personal package declarations and explicit `pi -e` arguments can still load `pi-recap`.

## Dynamic workflow retirement

AGRO no longer pins a dynamic workflow package, so a new Pi session registers no `workflow` tool. Use `/delegate` for bounded delegation over the Pi `Agent` tools.

A Pi session that is already running keeps the tool until you reload or restart it. A global installation or an explicit `pi -e` argument also registers the tool, so removing the project pin does not remove every registration source.

## Slack integration

The harness ships Slack via the **pi-messenger-bridge** npm package, loaded only in the dedicated `client-slack-pi` tmux session via `--extension` (not pinned in `.pi/settings.json`). Create/update the Slack app from `.pi/install/slack-manifest.yaml`, set `PI_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and `PI_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in `.devcontainer/.env`, manage the session with `gateway pi` (`gateway status` to check, `gateway pi --restart` after token edits), and use the Pi-side `/msg-bridge` command for bridge status/configuration. Access control is challenge-based (deny-by-default, no static allowlist); trusted-user/channel admin is handled by manifest-backed Slack admin commands or `.pi/msg-bridge.json` pre-seeding, and inbound Slack messages route into the agent via the package using Pi's native `sendUserMessage()` / `turn_end`.

See [Slack integration](../integrations/slack.md) for setup steps.
