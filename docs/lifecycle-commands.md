# Lifecycle commands (`agro`)

`agro` is the only front door to the sandbox lifecycle. This page is the single
source of truth for the verbs; every other document links here rather than
restating them.

`agro` is the only executable; AGRO retired the legacy `oh` alias (see the
[AGRO naming cutover](agro-compatibility.md)). Two verbs are easy to confuse:
[`agro self-upgrade`](#upgrading-the-cli-agro-self-upgrade) upgrades the
installed CLI, and [`agro vendor`](#equipping-a-checkout-agro-vendor) writes the
`.agro/` control plane into a checkout.

Every compose verb runs `.agro/scripts/docker-compose.sh`, which owns overlay
resolution, project naming, and env plumbing. `agro` is the surface; the script
is the mechanism.

A sandbox is a **registry entry** under `${AGRO_HOME:-~/.agro}/sandboxes/<name>/`.
`agro sandbox install docker` writes it, and every later verb finds it by name
from any directory — no project checkout required. A registry created by an
earlier release stays at `${AGRO_HOME:-~/.oh}/sandboxes/<name>/` and still
resolves; `agro migrate --home` moves it. Details:
[Configuration → the two `agro.json` files](configuration.md#the-two-agrojson-files).

Host prerequisites: **Docker** (with the Compose plugin), **Git**, and
**Node.js ≥ 20**. Node runs `agro` itself. When Node is missing, `get-agro.sh`
installs Node for you. Everything else — pnpm, Python, the agent CLIs — lives inside the
sandbox.

Project instructions live in `AGENTS.md`. Codex and Pi read the `AGENTS.md` name natively.
Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` from **2.1.277**; an older release, and a session on
Amazon Bedrock, Vertex or Foundry, reads no project instructions at all.

## The verbs

| Verb | Runs |
|---|---|
| `agro sandbox install <runtime> [--name <name>] [--checkout <dir>] [--yes] [--version <X.Y.Z>] [--image[=<ref>]] [--no-build]` | write the registry entry, then `docker-compose.sh up -d` inside it |
| `agro sandbox list [--json]` | every registry entry: name, runtime, status, checkout |
| `agro shell [name]` | an interactive `zsh` in the sandbox container |
| `agro stop [name]` | `docker-compose.sh stop` — containers down, volumes kept |
| `agro restart [name]` | `docker-compose.sh restart` |
| `agro logs [name]` | `docker-compose.sh logs -f` |
| `agro ps [name]` | `docker-compose.sh ps` |
| `agro destroy [name] [--yes]` | `docker-compose.sh down -v`, then remove the registry entry — see below |
| `agro compose config` | `docker-compose.sh config` — the resolved compose file |
| `agro update [--dry-run]` | upgrade the installed `agro` executable through the mechanism that installed it — see below |
| `agro migrate [--check] [--home] [--json]` | move a legacy `.agro/` project or `~/.oh` registry to the AGRO names — see below |
| `agro vendor [--from <dir> \| --from-remote [--ref <ref>]] [--dry-run] [--force]` | equip an empty checkout with `.agro/` + `crons/`, and upgrade an equipped one (compatibility window) |
| `agro config show [--sandbox <name>]` · `agro config set <field> <value> [--sandbox <name>]` | read and write `agro.json` |
| `agro config repo` · `agro config <integration>` | GitHub-remote and integration wizards |
| `agro secret set <KEY> [--sandbox <name>]` · `agro secret list [--sandbox <name>]` | read and write the gitignored `.env` |
| `agro config langfuse` | the interactive Langfuse tracing wizard — see below |
| `agro langfuse apply` · `agro langfuse status` · `agro langfuse disable` | render, check, or remove the Langfuse tracing files — see below |
| `agro gateway <pi\|hermes>` · `agro gateway status` | `.agro/scripts/gateway.sh` |
| `agro harness` · `agro tool` | install and inspect harnesses and tooling |
| `agro workspace create [<name>] [--path <dir>] [--ref <ref>] [--json]` · `agro workspace list [--json]` | create and list host AGRO workspaces under `~/.agro/workspaces/` — see below |
| `agro --help` · `agro --version` | usage and version |

`agro <verb> -- <args>` forwards extra arguments to `docker compose`, e.g.
`agro logs -- --tail 50`.

## Creating a sandbox

`agro sandbox install docker` is the one command that creates a sandbox. It runs
from **any** directory:

```bash
agro sandbox install docker      # wizard: name, timezone, git identity, SSH, Docker socket
agro shell <name>                # attach as the sandbox user
```

- The entry lands in `${AGRO_HOME:-~/.agro}/sandboxes/<name>/`, holding its own
  `agro.json`, its `.env`, and the compose files plus the wrapper script the CLI
  re-materialises on every lifecycle call. Edit `agro.json`; the CLI generates the rest.
- The default name is `agro-sbx-<n>`, the lowest unused number. `--yes` prompts
  zero times and keeps every default.
- Without `--checkout` the sandbox runs the prebuilt image and the image's
  `/opt/agro-seed` seeds the workspace volume. With `--checkout <dir>`, the CLI
  bind-mounts that checkout at `/home/sandbox/harness`, and the sandbox can build
  locally.
  `--repo <dir>` remains a supported alias. Recipes:
  [`agro sandbox install docker`](deployment-prebuilt-image.md).
- `docker` is the only provisionable runtime today. `agro sandbox install
  microsandbox` refuses and points at
  [the runtime RFC](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/blob/development/docs/rfcs/rfc-runtime-support.md); inside a sandbox,
  `agro tool install microsandbox` installs the `msb` binary.

`agro sandbox` with no subcommand prints help and exits non-zero.

## How a verb finds your sandbox

`agro shell|stop|restart|logs|ps|destroy [name]` resolve in this order:

1. the `name` you passed;
2. the single registered entry, when exactly one exists;
3. the entry whose `checkout` contains the current directory, under either that
   field or the alias `repo`;
4. otherwise an error listing every registered name.

`agro sandbox list` prints that list, with the container status of each.

`agro sandbox list --json` prints the same entries as JSON. Each entry carries the
bound directory under the key `checkout`. The JSON output keeps the key `repo` as
a deprecated key. It holds the identical value and stays present for existing consumers. Read
`checkout`.

## Upgrading the CLI: `agro self-upgrade`

`agro self-upgrade` (alias: `agro update`) upgrades exactly one thing: the running `agro` executable.
The upgrade writes no project file — no `.agro/`, no `agro.json`, no `.env` — and
the upgrade never asks for `sudo`. The upgrade follows whichever mechanism installed the
executable:

| Installation | Detected as | What `agro self-upgrade` does |
|---|---|---|
| `npm install -g @mifune/agro` | realpath under `node_modules/@mifune/agro/` | reads the registry version with `npm view`, then runs `npm install -g --prefix <owning prefix> @mifune/agro@<version>` |
| `get-agro.sh` | a plain file | downloads `AGRO_JS_URL` (default `https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/releases/latest/download/agro.js`) into the same directory, checks its shebang and `--version`, renames it over the executable, and keeps `<path>.prev` until the new file verifies |

`agro self-upgrade` refuses, and prints the supported procedure, in each of these
cases: the sandbox image ships the executable (`/opt/agro`); the executable is a
source checkout's `dist/`; the CLI cannot resolve the executable; the executable
sits in a read-only directory; another `agro` earlier on PATH shadows the
executable; or the executable does not report the running version. The upgrade
refuses a downgrade. When the installed version is already current, the upgrade
changes nothing. `--dry-run` reports the installation kind, target, and versions
without a change.

`agro self-upgrade` rejects the payload flags `--from`, `--from-remote`, `--ref`,
and `--force` and points at `agro vendor`.

## Equipping a checkout: `agro vendor`

`agro vendor` is the command that vendors the
`.agro/` control plane and `crons/` into the current directory. `agro vendor`
equips an empty directory from scratch and upgrades an equipped directory. Payload precedence:
`--from <dir>`, then `--from-remote [--ref <ref>]`, then the CLI's own bundled
payload, then a remote fetch announced on one line. `--dry-run` previews the
changes; `--force` overrides the up-to-date and downgrade gate.

It writes **nothing else** — no `agro.json`, no `.env`, no `AGENTS.md`, no
`.gitignore` line, no `.devcontainer/`, no provider configuration. Those files
are yours. `agro vendor` never prompts. `agro vendor` does not upgrade the CLI
itself; `agro update` does.

## Recovering from `missing lifecycle script`

A sandbox image can ship an `agro` CLI older than the checkout it runs against.
The old CLI looks for the legacy control directory `.agro/`. An AGRO checkout
carries `.agro/`. Every verb that runs a lifecycle script then fails:

```
$ agro gateway pi
missing lifecycle script /home/sandbox/harness/.agro/scripts/gateway.sh — the vendored .agro/ payload looks incomplete; run `agro vendor` to re-vendor it
```

The cause is the version skew between the installed CLI and the checkout, not
the missing payload that the message reports. The checkout is complete. The CLI
is too old to look in the right place.

**Ignore the advice in that message.** `agro vendor` vendors the control plane
into the current directory. The control plane is already there, under `.agro/`,
so a re-vendor changes nothing that matters here. `agro update` does not help
either: it upgrades the installed executable, and it refuses on an executable
that the sandbox image shipped.

```
image installation at /opt/agro/dist/agro.js — the sandbox image ships this CLI; pull a newer image on the host (agro stop, then agro sandbox install docker --name <name>)
```

**Confirm the skew.** Run both commands in the sandbox. Each one reads a file
and changes nothing.

```bash
grep '"version"' /opt/agro/package.json     # the CLI the image installed
grep '"version"' .agro/cli/package.json   # the CLI the checkout expects
```

A lower version in `/opt/agro/package.json` confirms the skew. The prefix
`/opt/agro` marks an **image** installation: the image built that CLI in, and
`/usr/local/bin/agro` resolves to `/opt/agro/dist/agro.js`.

**Refresh the image from the host.** Run both commands on the host. `agro
sandbox install docker` is host-only and refuses inside the sandbox.

This recovery costs downtime. The two commands stop the container and create it
again, so every agent, server, and job inside it stops. Only the sandbox home
volume survives the recreation. You pick the moment, and nothing runs these
commands for you.

```bash
agro stop <name>
agro sandbox install docker --name <name>
```

The second command writes the registry entry again and starts the container from
the current image, which carries a current CLI. That command keeps the sandbox
home volume. Only `agro destroy` removes that volume.

Keep the two `update` verbs apart:

| Command | Upgrades | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `agro update` | the installed `agro` executable | nothing in the project |
| `agro vendor` | the vendored control plane | `.agro/` and `crons/` in the current directory |

Details: [`agro self-upgrade`](#upgrading-the-cli-agro-self-upgrade) and
[`agro vendor`](#equipping-a-checkout-agro-vendor).

A current CLI names the recovery route for your own installation kind whenever a
lifecycle script is truly absent.

## Migrating to the AGRO names: `agro migrate`

`agro migrate` moves an installation created under the legacy names to the AGRO
names. It renames `.agro/` to `.agro/` and `agro.json` to `agro.json` wholesale,
and re-points three active provider links from `../.agro/…` to `../.agro/…`:
`.claude/skills`, `.claude/hooks`, and `.agents/skills`.
The retired links are `.pi/skills` and `.codex/skills`.
If a retired link resolves to the AGRO pack and `.agents/skills` independently links to that pack, migration moves the retired link to `<path>.migrated`.
Otherwise, migration preserves the retired path. Migration re-points a preserved
`../.agro/skills` link to `../.agro/skills` so discovery survives the pack rename.
Custom directories and foreign links remain unchanged. An existing retirement
marker blocks retirement without overwriting the marker.
Byte-identical legacy copies move to `<name>.migrated` instead of deletion.
`agro migrate` dispatches to the same command.

`bash .agro/scripts/link-providers.sh --init` repairs active links before retirement.
Unlike CLI migration, this script refuses custom retired paths and unresolved collisions.
Its `--check` mode reports retired links without changing files.
Fresh clones omit both retired links; `.codex/` and `.pi/` retain provider configuration.

Project mode is the default: it starts at the current directory and walks up to
the nearest ancestor holding `.agro/`, `.agro/`, `agro.json`, or `agro.json`.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--check` | print the plan and change nothing |
| `--home` | migrate the sandbox registry `~/.agro/sandboxes` → `~/.agro/sandboxes` instead of a project |
| `--json` | emit the plan (`--check`) or `{plan, result}` as JSON on stdout |

```bash
agro migrate --check   # plan the project in this directory
agro migrate           # apply it
agro migrate --home    # move the registry instead
```

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | applied, or nothing to do |
| `2` | refused: a conflict, or another run holds the `.agro-migrate.lock` |
| `1` | failure |

The migration is idempotent: a second run is a no-op. The migration never merges
and has no force option. The migration refuses divergent `.agro/` and `.agro/` (or
`agro.json` and `agro.json`) copies and names the differing entries. You keep
exactly one copy or make the copies identical. The migration preserves unknown
files, permission bits, and symlink targets, and never touches `~/.agro`, `.env`,
or git history.

## Where you are standing when you type `agro`

`agro` runs on the host **and** inside the sandbox, and it resolves a different
execution target for each. On the host it drives the container through Docker
Compose. Inside the sandbox it runs commands directly, because the sandbox *is*
the environment those commands target.

Detection is automatic: `agro` treats itself as in-sandbox when `/.dockerenv`
exists **and** `SANDBOX_NAME` holds a value. Override the detection with
`AGRO_EXECUTION_TARGET=local` or `AGRO_EXECUTION_TARGET=docker-compose`; the
legacy `AGRO_EXECUTION_TARGET` spelling still applies when the AGRO one is unset.

| Verb | On the host | Inside the sandbox |
|---|---|---|
| `agro harness install` | installs into the running container over Docker Compose; offers a host install when the container is not reachable | installs live, in place |
| `agro harness uninstall` | removes from the running container over Docker Compose; removes the recorded host install when the container is not reachable | removes live, in place |
| `agro tool install` | installs into the running container over Docker Compose; offers a host install when the container is not reachable and the catalog entry allows one | installs live, in place |
| `agro tool uninstall` | removes from the running container over Docker Compose; removes the recorded host install when the container is not reachable | removes live, in place |
| `agro harness list/status` | probes the host install prefix `~/.local` when the container is not reachable; reports `?` when neither a harness root nor that prefix exists | reports the real state of this environment |
| `agro tool list/status` | probes the host install prefix `~/.local` when the container is not reachable; reports `?` when neither a harness root nor that prefix exists | reports the real state of this environment |
| `agro sandbox install` | provisions the sandbox | refuses with a host-only error |
| `agro shell` | `docker exec` into the container | opens a local `zsh` |

`agro harness` and `agro tool` treat an unspawnable container runtime as an
unreachable sandbox. On a host with no Docker, `install`, `uninstall`, `list` and
`status` all use the host path instead of failing.

`agro sandbox install` changes the sandbox's own Docker configuration, so it stays
host-only rather than failing halfway.

`agro harness install <id>` and `agro tool install <id>` are the only way a harness
or a tool enters the sandbox. Nothing installs at boot, so a fresh sandbox has
no `herdr` until you run `agro tool install herdr`. Each install lands in
`~/.local` in the persistent home volume; `agro destroy` removes it.

`agro harness install <id>` also installs on the host. When the sandbox is not
running it uses an existing AGRO workspace as the harness root — `--workspace <name>` or
`--path <dir>`, then `harnessRoot` in `~/.agro/config.json`, then the registry entry
`~/.agro/workspaces/harness` — and installs the harness
into `~/.local` for the invoking user. The install prefix is never derived from
the harness root, so the clone stays clean. A non-interactive run needs `--host`
or `--path`; without either it keeps the refusal. See
[Harnesses Overview](harnesses/overview.md#installing-a-harness).

`agro tool install <id>` uses the same host path, with two limits. A tool must
declare a host install. `agent-browser`, `herdr`, `cloudflared`, `microsandbox`,
`tailscale`, `code-server`, `docker-engine`, and `desktop` declare a host install. `gh`
and the Docker CLI do not, because the sandbox image provides them. A host install
also needs Linux, because every tool installer is Debian-specific. The command
refuses on any other platform and names that platform. A successful host install
records the installed id as `hostTools` in the host `agro.json`, separately from
`hostHarnesses`. `agro tool uninstall <id>` has no `--host` flag. It removes only
what that record names when no sandbox is reachable, and `--force` removes from
`~/.local` without a record.

| Tool | Host install level | In the sandbox |
|------|--------------------|----------------|
| `code-server` | invoking user, `~/.local` | installs |
| `docker-engine` | root-level | refused; names `access.dockerSocket` |
| `desktop` | root-level | refused |

A root-level tool installs system packages as root. `agro tool list` marks it
`(root)`. When you are not root, the installer runs through `sudo -n`. When
`sudo -n true` fails, the command exits 1 and changes nothing. The message names
`<id>` and passwordless `sudo`.
`docker-engine` and `desktop` install only with `--host`, and `agro tool uninstall`
refuses them. `docker-engine` installs Docker Engine and Compose. `desktop` installs
XFCE, XRDP, and system Tailscale, and serves TCP 3389 only through Tailscale. It
ends by printing the two remaining steps: `sudo tailscale up` and
`sudo passwd <user>`. Then connect an RDP client to the Tailscale address on port
3389. See [Installation](installation.md#ai-agent-clis).

## Host workspaces: `agro workspace`

A **host workspace** is an AGRO checkout under
`${AGRO_HOME:-~/.agro}/workspaces/<name>/`. It carries the control plane that a
harness on the host reads: `AGENTS.md`, `.agro/skills/`, the hooks, and task
state. `agro workspace` is the only verb that creates one.

```bash
agro workspace create                     # clone into ~/.agro/workspaces/harness
agro workspace create default             # clone into ~/.agro/workspaces/default
agro workspace create acme                # clone into ~/.agro/workspaces/acme
agro workspace create --path /srv/agro    # clone into /srv/agro, outside the registry
agro workspace create --ref v0.15.0       # clone tag v0.15.0 into ~/.agro/workspaces/harness
agro workspace list                       # every workspace, with the default marked
agro workspace list --json                # the same rows as JSON
```

- `agro workspace create [<name>]` clones
  `https://github.com/mifunedev/agro.git` into the target directory. The command
  reuses a target that already holds a `.git` checkout, and clones nothing.
- The implicit name is `harness`. Pass `default` to create a workspace named
  `default`. The name becomes a path segment, so it obeys the sandbox name rule:
  lowercase letters, digits and dashes, starting with a letter or a digit. The
  command refuses any other name and creates nothing.
- `--path <dir>` creates the workspace outside the registry. Pass a name or
  `--path <dir>`, never both.
- `--ref <ref>` clones the branch or tag `<ref>` instead of the default branch.
  A tag gives a detached checkout. If `<ref>` does not exist, the command exits
  1, names the ref, and leaves no target directory. The command reuses a target
  that already holds a `.git` checkout and does not change its ref. `list`
  refuses `--ref`.
- `create` records no default. The command leaves `harnessRoot` in
  `~/.agro/config.json` unchanged. Only a host install writes that key.
- `agro workspace list` reports every child of `~/.agro/workspaces/` that obeys
  the name rule and holds a `.git` marker. The `DEFAULT` column marks the
  workspace that `harnessRoot` names. An empty registry prints one hint that
  names `agro workspace create`.
- `create` refuses two host states. A state home split across `~/.oh` and
  `~/.agro` refuses, and `agro migrate --home` repairs that split. A target
  directory equal to the state home refuses, and the message names the move to
  run.

`agro harness install --host` and `agro tool install --host` create no workspace.
Each verb resolves an existing workspace and exits 1 when none resolves. The
refusal lists every workspace that exists and names `agro workspace create`. See
[Harnesses Overview](harnesses/overview.md#installing-on-the-host).

## Langfuse tracing: `agro config langfuse` and `agro langfuse`

`agro config langfuse` is the interactive wizard, and the first integration in
the registry. `agro config --help` lists it. The wizard takes no flags and runs
five steps: enable, base URL, API keys, segmentation, and a health check before
the write.

Step 1 depends on the current state. With `langfuse.enabled` unset or `false`
the wizard asks *Enable Langfuse tracing?*, and a decline writes nothing. With
`langfuse.enabled` set to `true` the wizard asks *Keep it enabled?*, and a
decline runs the disable path. The wizard needs an interactive terminal.
Without a TTY the wizard asks nothing and runs `agro langfuse apply`.

The wizard writes the non-secret fields to the `langfuse` section of `agro.json`
and both keys to the gitignored `.env`. It then offers to install each missing
harness plugin and applies the configuration.

Three non-interactive verbs carry the rest:

| Verb | Runs |
|---|---|
| `agro langfuse apply` | render `~/.config/agro/langfuse.env` at mode `0600`, and one tracing file per harness |
| `agro langfuse status` | print the resolved settings, the state of every generated file, and the plugin state of each harness |
| `agro langfuse disable` | set `langfuse.enabled=false`, delete the credential fragment, and rewrite the harness files with tracing off |

These three verbs sit outside the integration registry on purpose. An
`Integration` is `{ description, runner: () => Promise<number> }`, and
`agro config <integration>` accepts no flags and no subcommand.

Four behaviours matter in a script:

- `status` exits non-zero when a generated file is missing or differs from a
  fresh render, so a check job can call it directly.
- `status` also exits `1` when `langfuse.enabled` is `false` and the credential
  fragment survives. The fragment is the off switch, and a stale fragment is the
  unsafe state. The message names `agro langfuse disable`.
- `disable` keeps the other `langfuse.*` settings and both `.env` keys, so
  re-enabling needs no re-prompt. `disable` then warns that a running harness
  keeps the credentials it loaded, and names the restart.
- The generated files live in the sandbox home. On the host, the wizard and
  `disable` save the settings, refuse the file work, name the sandbox command,
  and exit `1`. On the host, `status` prints the settings and exits `0`.

`.devcontainer/entrypoint.sh` runs `agro langfuse apply` at every start, so the
configuration survives `agro destroy` and a recreate. Full reference:
[Langfuse](integrations/langfuse.md).

## `agro destroy` and its confirmation policy

`down -v` wipes the sandbox home volume, and that volume holds provider
authentication. `agro destroy` is therefore the only lifecycle verb that asks
before it runs. `agro destroy` names the volumes to delete, as read
from `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, not hardcoded. Next, `agro destroy`
requires you to type the sandbox name. Any other input, including a blank line or
a wrong name, aborts with a non-zero exit and removes nothing.

After `down -v` succeeds, `agro destroy` also removes the registry entry under
`${AGRO_HOME:-~/.agro}/sandboxes/<name>/`, so the name becomes free again.

When `storage.homePath` points the home mount at a host path, `down -v` cannot
delete the host directory. `agro destroy` says so and leaves the directory in place.
To delete the directory, remove the directory yourself.

Non-interactive use requires an explicit flag. When stdin is not a terminal
and `--yes` is absent, `agro destroy` refuses outright rather than assume consent.

## `agro compose config`, not `agro config`

`agro config` already means *"read, write, or configure configuration"*
(`agro config show`, `agro config set`, `agro config <integration>`), so the
resolved-compose printer lives under its own namespace: `agro compose config`.
That leaves room for further `agro compose <passthrough>` verbs without ever
colliding with the config and integration verbs.

## VS Code "Reopen in Container" applies no overlays

Attaching VS Code to a container that `agro sandbox install docker` already
started is safe and is the recommended editor path — see
[Connecting to the sandbox](connecting.md).

**Provisioning** from VS Code is different. *Dev Containers: Reopen in
Container* reads `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, whose `dockerComposeFile`
lists `docker-compose.yml` and nothing else. It never runs
`.agro/scripts/docker-compose.sh`, so **no overlay applies on that path**:

- `access.ssh` → no `docker-compose.ssh.yml`, so no sshd and no published SSH port
- `access.dockerSocket` → no `docker-compose.docker-sock.yml`, so no host Docker socket
- `composeOverrides[]` → every extra overlay path is ignored

Secrets still reach that container: compose auto-loads the `.devcontainer/.env`
beside the compose file, and that file is a symlink to the root `.env`.
Non-secret `agro.json` settings only reach compose when `agro` renders them, so
on this path each variable falls back to its default in
`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`.

:::danger This path ignores `storage.homePath`
`AGRO_HOME_MOUNT` is one of those rendered-only variables, so *Reopen in
Container* falls back to the Docker-managed `<name>_workspace` volume even when
`storage.homePath` points the sandbox home at a host directory. The volume becomes a
**second, separate home**: agent logins made through `agro sandbox install docker` are not there,
and the two diverge silently from then on.

If you set `storage.homePath`, always provision with `agro sandbox install
docker` and attach.
:::

If you need any overlay, provision with `agro sandbox install docker`. Then use
*Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container* instead of *Reopen in Container*.
