# Contributing to AGRO

This guide covers the workflow for contributing to AGRO: creating branches, writing commits, updating the changelog, and shipping releases.

For the inbound license terms and the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), see the root [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

Contributions are prepared **inside a sandbox**, not from a host-side source checkout.
Host requirements are the same as any other install: Docker (with `docker compose`),
`git`, and Node.js ≥ 20 to run the `agro` CLI. See
[Installation → Get the CLI](./installation.md#get-the-cli-agro).

### Provision the sandbox

The lifecycle is driven entirely by `agro`:

```bash
agro sandbox install docker   # write the registry entry and start the sandbox
agro shell <name>             # enter the sandbox as the `sandbox` user
agro ps <name>                # show service status
agro logs <name>              # tail compose logs
agro stop <name>              # stop the sandbox, preserving volumes
agro destroy <name>           # stop and remove the sandbox (volumes wiped)
agro restart <name>           # restart the service
agro --help                   # list every verb
```

### Onboard inside the sandbox

After `agro shell`, install and start Herdr before any other inside-sandbox setup.
A fresh sandbox has none, because nothing installs at boot:

```bash
agro tool install herdr
herdr
```

From the initial Herdr pane, complete GitHub authentication so `git push` and `gh` work
from within the container. Run the checks in order and confirm the account before you
continue — details in [GitHub auth](./integrations/github.md):

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth setup-git
gh auth status
```

Then install and start agents from Herdr panes — nothing is baked into the image:

```bash
agro harness install claude-code   # claude
agro harness install codex         # codex
agro harness install pi            # pi
```

### Get the source into the sandbox

Clone the repository inside the sandbox, in a Herdr pane:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mifunedev/agro.git
cd agro
```

If this sandbox already holds your own workspace, do not replace it. Check whether the
workspace shares history with the canonical repository (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`
against a fetched upstream ref). When it does, add an `upstream` remote and branch from
it without touching your private `origin`. When it does not, use a separate ordinary
clone inside the sandbox, as above, and move only the changes you select into it. Keep
private configuration, credentials, and unrelated files out of the contribution. The
[contribution prompt](./quickstart.md#optional-prompt--prepare-an-agro-contribution) walks
an authenticated agent through the same decision.

A checkout equipped before the AGRO cutover carries `.agro/` and `agro.json`. Both still
resolve; run `agro migrate --check` and then `agro migrate` to move it.

### Local validation

Use the fast harness build for routine development:

```bash
pnpm run build          # fast non-docs build
pnpm run test:scripts   # root script + .pi extension tests
bash .agro/skills/eval/run.sh
```

The rendered docs site is maintained in [`mifunedev/agro-web`](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro-web). In this core repo, validate docs by checking the Markdown links and the GitHub-readable index at `docs/README.md`; no Docusaurus build runs here.

### Multi-agent messaging (Slack)

Slack (and other messengers) bridge to a Pi agent via the
[`pi-messenger-bridge`](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-messenger-bridge) npm package. The
harness installs it into a gitignored `.pi/bridge/` directory and loads it via `--extension`
only in the dedicated `client-slack-pi` tmux session (managed by `.agro/scripts/gateway.sh`) —
you don't run `pi install` yourself. Full setup (tokens, trust, the sibling Hermes gateway)
lives in [Slack integration](./integrations/slack.md).

## Branch Naming

All feature branches follow the format `<prefix>/<issue#>-<short-desc>`.

Prefixes: `feat` · `bug` · `task`

Short description: kebab-case, maximum 5 words.

Example:

```
feat/42-slack-thread-replies
```

Create your branch off the default target (`development` if it exists, otherwise `main`):

```bash
git checkout -b feat/42-slack-thread-replies development
```

## Commit Messages

Commit format: `<type>: <description>`

Types: `feat` · `fix` · `task`

Example:

```
feat: add Slack thread replies for multi-channel mode
```

## CHANGELOG Entries

Every pull request with user-visible impact must add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` in the same commit as your change.

Categories: `### Added` · `### Changed` · `### Fixed` · `### Removed` · `### Deprecated` · `### Security`

Format: one line, imperative mood, link to your PR or issue.

Example:

```markdown
### Added
- Slack thread replies in multi-channel mode ([#42](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/pull/42)).
```

Skip CHANGELOG entries only for pure chores with no runtime or workflow effect (refactors, test fixes, typos). When in doubt, add an entry.

## Pull Requests

Target the default branch (`development`). Title format: `FROM <source-branch> TO <target-branch>` (literal).

Example:

```
FROM feat/42-slack-thread-replies TO development
```

Link the issue in the title or the body with a closing keyword:

```
Closes #42
```

`Closes`, `Fixes` and `Resolves` all work, and each grammatical variant works
(`Closed`, `Fixed`, `Resolved`). List every issue the pull request completes —
one keyword per issue. A bare `#42` links the issue but does not close it.

When the pull request merges into `development`, the workflow
[`.github/workflows/close-issues-on-development.yml`](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/blob/development/.github/workflows/close-issues-on-development.yml)
closes each referenced issue as `completed`. Closing the pull request without
merging it closes no issue. A pull request opened from a fork gets a read-only
token, so close its issue by hand.

Create the PR:

```bash
gh pr create --base development \
  --title "FROM feat/42-slack-thread-replies TO development" \
  --body "Closes #42"
```

## Releases

AGRO uses SemVer versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, tagged
`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Root `package.json` holds the release version.
The canonical CLI package and its lockfile must match that version.

A release is a deliberate bump, not a side effect of a push. Every push to
`main` or `master` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which validates the
commit, then publishes the version `package.json` names:

1. Validation, boot-path lint, and the eval probe suite must pass first
2. The workflow reads the version from root `package.json`
3. Creating `refs/tags/v<version>` reserves the version — this act is atomic
4. Build and smoke-test the image
5. Push the GHCR image tags `:<version>` and `:sha-<SHA>`, both bare — the `v`
   prefix belongs to the git tag, not to the registry
6. Promote `latest` by immutable digest from the canonical branch
7. Publish the CLI
8. Publish the GitHub Release

To cut a release, update root `package.json`, `.agro/cli/package.json`, and its lockfile to the same version.
Add the matching
`## [<version>]` section to `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR, then promote
`development` to `main`. If you push to `main` without bumping the version, the
run is a clean, **green** no-op: the reserve step reports the version as already
released and every publication job skips.

Do **not** manually pre-create a release tag or a `release/<version>` branch.

Run the release skill from inside the orchestrator sandbox:

```bash
/release
```

For the full workflow, see the `git` and `release` skills in `.agro/skills/`.

### Release helpers

`.github/workflows/release.yml` drives the release scripts in `.agro/scripts/`.
`reserve-github-release.mjs` uses the GitHub API user agent `agro-release-reservation`.
The smoke sandbox name is `agro-release-smoke-<run id>`.
`promote-release-latest.sh` defaults `IMAGE_REPOSITORIES` to
`ghcr.io/mifunedev/agro ghcr.io/mifunedev/agro`.
The `agro` digest is the reference that the legacy image alias must match.
The GHCR package `mifunedev/agro` must be public before consumers can pull its tags.

### Documentation notification

After a real release's `finalize` succeeds, `notify-docs` sends `repository_dispatch`:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `AGRO_WEB_REPO`, default `mifunedev/agro-web`. |
| Event type | `agro-release`. |
| Payload | `{ "ref": "<released sha>" }`, from `needs.reserve.outputs.releaseSha`. |
| Credential | `AGRO_WEB_DISPATCH_TOKEN`, passed as `GH_TOKEN`. |

The token needs Contents read/write access on the docs repository.
A classic token needs the `repo` scope.
If the secret is absent, the job prints a notice and exits 0 without dispatching.
Set the destination and upload the token from a file:

```bash
gh secret set AGRO_WEB_DISPATCH_TOKEN --repo mifunedev/agro < token-file
gh variable set AGRO_WEB_REPO --repo mifunedev/agro --body mifunedev/agro-web
```

Do not place the token value in shell history or logs.
