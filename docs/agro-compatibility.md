# AGRO naming: the cutover is complete

This project finished migrating from the former Open Harness name to AGRO
(Agent Governance Runtime Orchestrator) under epic
[#939](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/issues/939). Phase 5
([#1061](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/issues/1061)) retired the
compatibility layer. AGRO now has exactly one spelling for every surface.

This page records what the retirement removed and how to move a project that
still uses the old names.

## The one spelling

| Surface | Name |
|---|---|
| CLI executable | `agro` |
| npm package | `@mifune/agro` |
| Project control directory | `.agro/` |
| Project config file | `agro.json` |
| Environment variables | `AGRO_*` |
| Host registry home | `~/.agro` |
| Image seed | `/opt/agro-seed` |
| First-boot marker | `.agro/.image-seeded` |
| systemd units | `agro-bootstrap.service`, `agro-cron.service` |
| Repository, docs host | `mifunedev/agro`, `agro.mifune.dev` |

The TypeScript module that holds these names is
[`.agro/cli/src/lib/layout.ts`](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/blob/development/.agro/cli/src/lib/layout.ts). The boot-safe
shell adapter is [`.agro/scripts/paths.sh`](https://github.com/mifunedev/agro/blob/development/.agro/scripts/paths.sh); it needs
only bash and coreutils, so the entrypoint can use it before Node or the control
plane exists.

## What the retirement removed

- The `oh` executable and the `@mifune/openharness` npm shim. Neither is
  published any more.
- The dual-spelling resolver. `.oh/`, `oh.json`, `OH_*`, `~/.oh` and
  `/opt/oh-seed` are no longer read.
- The `agro migrate` command. It existed to move a project or registry from the
  old names to the new ones; with the old names gone it has nothing to resolve.
- The `openharness-bootstrap.service` and `openharness-cron.service` units.
- The `get-oh.sh` installer and the `dist/oh.js` release artifact.

`agro update` still works: it is an alias of `agro self-upgrade`. Project
payload vendoring, which used to be `oh update`, is now `agro vendor`.

## Moving a project that still uses the old names

Do this once, on the host, with the sandbox stopped. None of it needs the CLI.

Rename the project control plane and config:

```bash
git mv .oh .agro
git mv oh.json agro.json
```

Rename the host registry home:

```bash
mv ~/.oh ~/.agro
```

Rename any `OH_*` variables in your shell profile, CI configuration and
`.env` files to `AGRO_*`. The CLI no longer reads the `OH_` prefix and will not
warn about one it finds.

### Re-vendor before you upgrade the image

An existing sandbox workspace volume still holds the control plane that was
vendored into it before the cutover. That copy reads the retired `OH_*`
variables, which the new image no longer sets, so its provider linking cannot
run. The sandbox still boots — the entrypoint reports the problem and
continues rather than failing the unit — but agents have no linked skills
until the control plane is re-vendored.

Re-vendor the control plane and re-link the providers:

```bash
agro vendor
bash .agro/scripts/link-providers.sh --init
```

If you pinned `@mifune/openharness`, install the canonical package instead:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @mifune/openharness
npm install -g @mifune/agro
```

A sandbox created before the cutover keeps its named volumes. Recreate the
container against the renamed registry entry:

```bash
agro stop <name>
agro sandbox install docker --name <name>
```

## Verifying the cutover

Two probes guard the retirement:

- `.agro/evals/probes/version-parity.sh` fails if `.agro/cli/legacy/` returns.
- `.agro/scripts/verify-sandbox-image.sh` fails if a built image still ships an
  `oh` entry point.

Run the suite with `bash .agro/skills/eval/run.sh`.
