# Configuration

AGRO has two authored configuration surfaces, split by kind:

| File | Tracked | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agro.json` | yes | every non-secret setting |
| `.env` | no — gitignored, mode `0600` | secrets only |

A secret must never reach `agro.json`, because git tracks `agro.json`. A non-secret
must never reach `.env`. Code enforces the split:
`.agro/cli/src/lib/secrets.ts` owns the secret allow-list,
`.agro/cli/src/lib/agro-config.ts` owns the `agro.json` schema and validator, and
`.agro/cli/src/lib/config-render.ts` refuses to render an allow-listed secret into
the compose environment.

## The two `agro.json` files

The same schema has two homes, and the flag you pass picks one:

| Home | Path | Written by | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Registry entry** | `${AGRO_HOME:-~/.agro}/sandboxes/<name>/agro.json` | `agro sandbox install docker`, then `agro config set --sandbox <name>` | the sandbox: `name`, `runtime`, `checkout`, `timezone`, `git.*`, `access.*`, `image.*`, `storage.homePath`, `composeOverrides` |
| **Project** | `<repo>/agro.json` | you, and `agro config set` with no flag | the settings a checkout wants to carry in git |

A registry entry created by an earlier release stays at
`${AGRO_HOME:-~/.oh}/sandboxes/<name>/agro.json`, and a checkout equipped by one
keeps `.agro/` and `agro.json`. Both keep resolving under either executable name;
`agro migrate` and `agro migrate --home` move them when you choose. Every verb
below uses the `agro` CLI.

`agro sandbox install docker` writes the registry entry and, beside it, the
compose files and the compose wrapper. The CLI **generates** those files and
re-materialises them on every lifecycle call, so edit only `agro.json` there.
A registry entry keeps its own gitignored `.env`, written with
`agro secret set <KEY> --sandbox <name>`.

The project `agro.json` is the seed, not the sandbox. `agro sandbox install
docker --checkout <dir>` reads the project `agro.json` once to pre-fill the wizard;
after that, the entry is authoritative. The CLI writes nothing else into a checkout — no
`AGENTS.md`, no provider configuration, no `.gitignore` line other than the
`.env` line `agro secret set` adds inside a git checkout.

`agro config show` prints the resolved `agro.json` and `agro config set <field>
<value>` edits one dotted field in it; `agro secret set <KEY>` prompts for a
credential with the input hidden and writes it to `.env`, and `agro secret list`
shows which keys hold a value with the values redacted. Both accept
`--sandbox <name>` to act on a registry entry instead of the project.
`agro config set` refuses a secret key and `agro secret set` refuses a non-secret
key, each pointing at the other command. Apply a change with
`agro stop <name> && agro sandbox install docker --name <name>`.

## How `agro.json` reaches the sandbox

There are two routes, and which one a field takes follows one rule:

> A value reaches the sandbox through Compose only if a process **outside** the
> sandbox — or the entrypoint **before** the control plane is readable — must act
> on it. For every other value, the `agro` CLI reads the value from `agro.json`.

**Through Compose.** `.agro/cli/src/lib/config-render.ts` renders those fields into
`KEY=value` lines and `.agro/scripts/docker-compose.sh` passes them to Compose with
`--env-file`. Each also has a default baked into
`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, so an omitted field is not "unset" — it takes
that default. A variable already exported in the shell that runs `agro` beats
the value in `agro.json`.

**Through the CLI.** The container reads every other value when a process needs
the value — `.devcontainer/entrypoint.sh` calls `agro config show`. Adding a
tool, harness, or setting therefore requires no Compose edit. `config-render.ts`
keeps a `RETIRED_KEYS` list and throws if a later change renders one of those keys again.

## Field reference

Types are JSON types. "Compose variable" names the variable the field renders
to; `—` means the field never reaches Compose — the `agro` CLI reads the field,
or the CLI consumes the field itself.

### Identity

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | number | `1` | — | Schema version. Must be `1`. |
| `name` | string | directory name | `SANDBOX_NAME` | Container and Compose project name. |
| `runtime` | `"docker"` | unset | — | The runtime that provisioned the entry. `agro sandbox install docker` writes the field; `docker` is the only value today. |
| `checkout` | string | unset | `AGRO_REPO_DIR` (legacy alias `AGRO_REPO_DIR`) | Absolute **host** path of a checkout to bind-mount at `/home/sandbox/harness`, set by `agro sandbox install docker --checkout <dir>`. The CLI selects the build-capable compose base only when that path holds `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`. This field also lets a lifecycle verb resolve this sandbox from inside that directory. Unset means image-only: the entrypoint seeds the workspace volume from the image's `/opt/agro-seed`. The field `repo` and the flag `--repo` remain supported aliases. A file that holds both fields uses `checkout`. Either field renders to the Compose variable `AGRO_REPO_DIR`. A file that holds `repo` keeps that field. The CLI does not rewrite that field. |
| `timezone` | string | `America/Los_Angeles` | `TZ` | Timezone for cron schedules and log timestamps. |
| `storage.homePath` | string | unset | `AGRO_HOME_MOUNT` (legacy alias `AGRO_HOME_MOUNT`) | Absolute **host** path for the single `/home/sandbox` mount. Leave unset and Docker manages it as the named volume `<name>_workspace`. Must start with `/`; use a dedicated empty directory, since the sandbox takes ownership of every file in that directory. Set this field at create time with `agro sandbox install docker --home-mount <dir>`. The flag resolves the argument to an absolute path. The flag creates the directory when the directory is absent. The flag accepts a non-empty directory. `agro config set storage.homePath <dir>` refuses the change when the named volume `<name>_workspace` already exists. The next start would swap the mount source and orphan every file in that volume. Pass `--force` to override the refusal. A stale `AGRO_HOME_MOUNT` (or legacy `AGRO_HOME_MOUNT`) in `.devcontainer/.env` outranks this value, because the wrapper passes the dotenv last. |

### Git identity inside the sandbox

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `git.userName` | string | unset | `GIT_USER_NAME` | `user.name` for commits made inside the sandbox. Spaces are fine. |
| `git.userEmail` | string | unset | `GIT_USER_EMAIL` | `user.email` for commits made inside the sandbox. |

### Harness and tool installs

`agro.json` holds no install field. A harness or tool enters the sandbox only when
you run `agro harness install <id>` or `agro tool install <id>`. Nothing installs
at boot. The install lands in `~/.local` inside the persistent home volume, and
`agro destroy` removes it. See
[Harnesses Overview](harnesses/overview.md#installing-a-harness) and
[Installation](installation.md).

### Access

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `access.dockerSocket` | boolean | `false` | `DOCKER_SOCKET` | Applies the `docker-compose.docker-sock.yml` overlay. Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` is effectively HOST ROOT: an agent can start a privileged container that mounts the host filesystem. See [security considerations](security-considerations.md). |
| `access.ssh` | boolean | `false` | `SANDBOX_SSH` | Applies the `docker-compose.ssh.yml` overlay, which runs sshd for direct container SSH. See [sshd](integrations/sshd.md). |
| `access.sshPort` | number (1–65535) | `2222` | `SANDBOX_SSH_PORT` | Host loopback port published for SSH. |
| `access.sshAuthorizedKeys` | string | unset | — | One or more public keys, newline or literal `\n` separated, read by `entrypoint.sh` through `agro config show`. The field holds public key material, not a secret. Without a key and without password auth nobody can log in, and sshd warns loudly. |
| `access.sshPasswordAuth` | boolean | `false` | — | Enables SSH password auth, which uses the `SANDBOX_PASSWORD` secret. Never enable password auth on a public-facing bind while `SANDBOX_PASSWORD` is the default. |

### Hermes dashboard

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hermesDashboard.enabled` | boolean | `false` | — | Auto-starts the web dashboard in the `app-hermes-dashboard` tmux session, bound to container loopback. |
| `hermesDashboard.port` | number (1–65535) | `9119` | — | Container loopback port for the dashboard. Compose no longer publishes the port to the host; reach the dashboard from inside the sandbox, or over cloudflared or Tailscale. |

### Cron runtime

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cron.agentBin` | string | `claude` | — | Binary that fires scheduled tasks. |

### Build behaviour

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build.skipPnpmInstall` | boolean | `false` | — | `true` skips the entrypoint's root `pnpm install`. Use `true` when a process outside the sandbox manages the dependency tree. |

### Langfuse tracing

`agro config langfuse` writes these four fields. The two Langfuse keys are
secrets and live in `.env`, not here. `agro langfuse apply` reads both surfaces
and renders them into the credential fragment `~/.config/agro/langfuse.env` and
into one tracing file per harness. See [Langfuse](integrations/langfuse.md).

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `langfuse.enabled` | boolean | `false` | — | Turns tracing on. `agro langfuse apply` writes the credential fragment only when this field is `true`. `agro langfuse disable` sets it to `false` and deletes the fragment. |
| `langfuse.baseUrl` | string | `https://cloud.langfuse.com` | — | Endpoint each harness sends traces to. Pick the URL from where the harness runs, not from where you browse. |
| `langfuse.environment` | string | the `name` field, else `sandbox` | — | Trace environment. Langfuse stores it at write time, so choose the name before you collect traces. |
| `langfuse.userId` | string | unset | — | User id for Pi traces. It reaches `~/.pi/agent/langfuse.json` only. |

### Prebuilt image

Run a published image instead of building from `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.
Recipe: [`agro sandbox install docker`](deployment-prebuilt-image.md).

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image.ref` | string | `ghcr.io/mifunedev/agro:<CLI version>` | `AGRO_SANDBOX_IMAGE` | Published image reference. Set the field per sandbox with `agro config set --sandbox <name> image.ref <ref>`. `agro sandbox install docker` writes this field only for an explicit pin: `--version <X.Y.Z>` or `--image=<ref>`. Without a pin, each start of an `image`-mode sandbox renders the default. If the CLI version is not a plain `X.Y.Z` release, the default tag is `latest`. The install preserves a configured value. |
| `image.mode` | `"build"` \| `"image"` | `build` | — | Whether the lifecycle builds locally or runs `image.ref`. A build happens only when the entry carries `checkout` and that directory holds `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`. Pairs with `agro sandbox install docker --image`. |
| `image.pullPolicy` | `"missing"` \| `"always"` \| `"never"` | `missing` | `AGRO_PULL_POLICY` (legacy alias `AGRO_PULL_POLICY`) | Compose pull policy for `image.ref`. |

### Compose overlays

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What the field does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `composeOverrides` | string[] | `[]` | — | Extra `-f` overlay paths, applied after the built-in overlays selected by `access` (last `-f` wins). |

## Secrets

The allow-list in `.agro/cli/src/lib/secrets.ts` is the complete set of keys the
root `.env` may hold. The tracked `.example.env` documents each key, commented
out:

`GH_TOKEN`, `SANDBOX_PASSWORD`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `META_API_KEY`, `PI_SLACK_APP_TOKEN`,
`PI_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`,
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.

`agro secret set` rejects any other key.

For Muse Code, `agro secret set META_API_KEY` stores the key but does not export it into a running shell.
See [Muse authentication](harnesses/muse-code.md#authentication) for process injection and credential precedence.

### TypeSafe

`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` authenticates the TypeSafe System One judgment adapter at
`.agro/scripts/typesafe.mjs`. Set it with `agro secret set TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, or add it
to `.env` and load it with `set -a; source .env; set +a`.

`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is deliberately absent from every compose `environment:` block. A value reaches the
sandbox through Compose only if a process outside the sandbox — or the entrypoint before
the control plane is readable — must act on it, and nothing outside the sandbox acts on
this key. `.agro/evals/probes/typesafe-key-boundary.sh` fails if it ever appears there.

**Unconfigured fails loudly, then continues.** Without the key, every consumer prints a
diagnostic naming the variable and the command that sets it, then falls back to its
deterministic path and completes. Nothing silently degrades and nothing crashes. The
same applies to an invalid key, a timeout, or an unreachable host, each reported as a
distinct cause. Check the current state with:

```bash
node .agro/scripts/typesafe.mjs           # is the key set?
node .agro/scripts/typesafe.mjs --live    # does the key work?
```

Consumers are opt-in. `prompt-miner --judge` is the only one today; without the flag the
engine never consults TypeSafe.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | What the variable does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGRO_NO_STAR_PROMPT` | unset | `1` suppresses the one-time line `⭐ If AGRO helps, star https://github.com/mifunedev/agro` that `agro sandbox install` prints after its first successful install. The line also stays off when `CI` is set and not empty, or when stdout is not a TTY. The marker `${AGRO_HOME:-~/.agro}/star-prompt-shown` records that the line was shown. |

## Retired keys

The directory layout follows a fixed convention, and no setting changes the layout.
AGRO removed `WORKTREES_DIR`, `PROJECTS_DIR`, and `CRONS_DIR`;
`config-render.ts` refuses to render them. See
[`.agro/` directory layout](agro-directory-layout.md).
